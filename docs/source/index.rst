**ADAQ** is a collection of automatic workflows used for high-throughput calculations of point defects in semiconductors.
These workflows are implemented using the High-Throughput Toolkit (|httk|_).

.. |httk| replace:: *httk*

Required software
------------

* `VASP`_
* Python 2.7
* `tess`_
* `PyVaspwfc`_ (embedded)
* |httk|_
* isotropy
* jmol (optional)
