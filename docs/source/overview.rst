Overview
------------

ADAQ automates the following steps in the theoretical process of calculating point defects:

- relaxes the host unit cell.
- creates the defect supercells with arbitrarily sized defect clusters.
- screens these defects for the most relevant properties.
- fully characterizes the point defects including zero phonon lines (ZPL), zero field splitting (ZFS), and hyperfine coupling parameters.
